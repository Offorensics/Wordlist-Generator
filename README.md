# Wordlist Generator

Wordlist Generator allows you to create custom wordlists that can be used in different situations, such as wordlist attacks. This is especially designed to be used when you have gained some knowledge of the target. Alternatively, can be used to create more variation from different default passwords. The generator is written for Python 3+ interpreter, doesn't require any non-native modules and is tested Linux (Ubuntu 16.04, Kali 2017.2) and Windows (10) environments. 

## How to use

The generator takes two command line parameters. The first parameter provided is an input file. The input file should contain a list of words (one per line, no spaces), or at least one word. The second parameter is an output file, which will be your new wordlist. The output filename can be anything that respects the basic filename rules. While generally whitespaces in names are allowed, their use is highly discouraged and may lead to unexpected results.

**Only one step, open your command prompt and type the following**

`python wlgenerator.py <your_inputfile> <your_outputfile>`

Outcome may look something like this
